I still have a home, and still lead a house church, among other things.  So everything really points to this ending up pretty much the same way the last time I tried blogging ended - a handful of posts and then dormant.  I pride myself at not quitting, but blogging has always gotten the best of me.

It's part of who I am, and there seems to be community of people out there like myself who are grinding away at the job day-in and day-out, helping one another solve problems by simply taking the time to share, many times without knowing how their work helped another.  I use blogs daily to help solve the problems I face in my role as a devloper, but sometimes it takes my own work to figure out the solution.  I need to give back.  I want to give back.   So why try this blogging things again?  I simply say:
